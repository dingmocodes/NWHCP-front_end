          NWHCP seeks to connect underrepresented students of all ages who are interested in pursuing a career in healthcare to pathway and education programs that will help them to achieve their professional development goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          To do so, we collect and distribute information on what we call
          pathway or outreach programs. Students can access this information on
          our website, allowing them to identify opportunities in their local
          area. Our hope is that other users like advisors, counselors, and
          program administrators will also utilize this information to direct
          students and find ways to bridge gaps in programming.

            The pathway programs on our map provide opportunities for under-represented students to gain the skills required to achieve their goal of entering health profession schools and training programs. A student may create their own “pathway” by participating in a series of programs starting in secondary school through college and beyond.  These programs are sometimes referred to as pipeline, supplemental and enrichment activities, or professional development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, pathway programs help to build a healthcare workforce that reflects our communities. This site works to connect students to systems that improve equity and access to education

          Schools and training programs are also represented on our map. It’s important for students to identify their end goal as they work to create a “pathway” to get there
